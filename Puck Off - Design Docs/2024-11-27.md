I currently like where the game's core gameplay mechanics, the vehicle controls and physics, are at. All that's left now is to make the support systems like menus, game managers and match logic handlers.
What should I start with? Obviously the match handler logic. Stuff like the timer, the goal counter, the goal reset...
